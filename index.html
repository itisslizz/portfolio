            <h3>How I Work</h3>
            <p>During studies and working on projects I learned one of the most important things
              when creating something is to keep an oversight. The bigger the project the harder this is.
              That is why I try to stick to the following plan.</p>
            <h4>1 - What</h4>
            <p>
              The first step is to come up with the "What" i.e. what do I want to build? A simple idea, for example
              "a photo app" is not enough. I want to think about the concrete functionalities, the platforms and the target group.
              Once that is figured out, I try to come up with the basic architecture and a first design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Further down the line, issues may arrise that have not been thought of or initial ideas may not seem
              like the right choice anymore. This is why these first decisions are not set in stone and might be subject
              to change.
            </P>
            <h4>2 - How</h4>
            <p>
              If the "What" is properly defined I move on to step 2, the "How". Here I think about what technologies
              I want to use for building my project. Which language, which frameworks, which libraries are best suited
              to help me accomplish my goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is especially hard for web projects, as there is an enormous variety of technologies out there. My thought
              process also varies. At times I like to stick to what I know in order to feel comfortable and work at a high
              efficiency from the beginning. Other times I might prefer looking into new or unknown technologies to learn
              something new and maybe find something I prefer to other things in my repertoire.
            </p>
            <h4>3 - Setup</h4>
            <p>
              The next step is the "Setup". This includes creating the project, installing the dependencies decided on in step 2,
              initiating a git repo for version control and get a template ready to expand.
            </p>
            <h4>4 - Split It</h4>
            <p>When working on a bigger project it can quickly occure that one goes in over his head and loses motivation and concentration.
            To avoid that I split up the project into smaller pieces and tasks (for bigger projects this can also be multi-level). This makes
            it both easier to keep the oversight as well as reaching goals faster this in turn keeps my motivation high. </p>
            <h4>5 - Develop</h4>
            <p>Now looking at the split up project I pick a task, one that is not dependant on other incompleted tasks and try to complete it in two steps and repeat them
              until I am satisfied.</p>
            <h5>5.1 - Build It</h5>
            <p>Write the code and implement or fix the picked task. Keep the code clean, methods small and use comments.</p>
            <h5>5.2 - Test It </h5>
            <p>Test the built part of the project, either manually or preferrably write an automated test. If testing fails we go back to fix the part, if it
            is successful we move on and pick the next task.</p>

                <p>For my Master Thesis I built a Smart Heating Control System which consisted of several parts. The controller itself was built in python and ran on a RaspberryPi. Its task
                consists of collecting data from various sensors, deriving a control strategy and then implement this strategy on the heaters. The code for this part can be found on
                <a href="https://github.com/itisslizz/HeatingController">GitHub</a>.</p>
                <h4><a href="https://github.com/itisslizz/RegisterAtHome">Android App</a></h4>
                <p>A smaller part was a small Android App designed to record timestamps of disconnecting and connecting to the home WiFi network as well as send these timestamps to the controller.
                  The code for the App can be found <a href="https://github.com/itisslizz/RegisterAtHome">here</a>.

                <h4>Concerning Movies</h4>
                <p>
                  I have created many projects during the course of my studies at ETH and in my free time. One idea that I keep coming back to is
                  to improve the social experience of watching movie. Currently I am working on two projects focusing on this idea. Both are not complete
                  as of now.
                </p>
                <h5>Movie Journal</h5>
                <p>
                  The first one is a web application allowing a user to maintain a journal of movies he watched as well as a watchlist of movies
                   he wants to watch. Previous versions were built using PHP. The current version consists of a back end built using Python and Django
                   and the front end built using AngularJS. Find the links to the repositories below.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   <a href="https://github.com/itisslizz/MJRestApi">Back end</a><br>
                   <a href="https://github.com/itisslizz/MJFrontEnd">Front end</a>
                </p>
                <h5>Movie Selector</h5>
                <p>
                  Project number two is concerned with finding a smarter way to decide which movie to watch as a group. It is an Android App on the front end
                  the back end is built using Python Django and the excellent django-rest-framework. The code for the Android App is currently not available on GitHub.
                  The source code for the backend is <a href="https://github.com/itisslizz/MovieSelector">here</a>.
